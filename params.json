The main purpose was to have a falsecolor script for Windows but I added a few extra bits on the way.\r\n\r\n`wxfalsecolor` is a graphical frontend to `falsecolor2`. It also implements a few features of ximage so it can be used to display Radiance RGBE images and read luminance/illuminance values.\r\n\r\nLike the original `falsecolor2` relies on the Radiance image tools which you need to have installed on your system.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n`falsecolor2` supports all features of the original `falsecolor`. I have added a few new features and some of the original features behave a bit differently:\r\n* The formatting of the default legend is different.\r\n* `-cb` creates a falsecolor image of discreet colours instead of an obese variation of contour lines.\r\n* `-h` shows a summary of the command line options. This option does not create an image but prints a help message to stdout (terminal).\r\n* `-lp` allows you to specify the legend position; legends above and below the image are horizontal instead of vertical.\r\n* `-mask <minvalue>` masks all values below minvalue with the background color (black).\r\n* `-z` creates legends starting at 0\r\n* `-s auto` option for automatic legend scale adjustment\r\n\r\nWith `wxfalsecolor` you can\r\n* load and display Radiance RGBE images\r\n* drag-and-drop images in a desktop environment\r\n* view image headers\r\n* display RGB and Lux values (even after conversion to falsecolor image)\r\n* set `falsecolor2` options interactively\r\n* set `pcond` options interactively\r\n* display labels for spot and average pixel values (like `ximage`)\r\n* save image as bitmap\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nTODO: link to github sites\r\n\r\n## History\r\nThe code base was migrated from the original 'pyrat' repository on code.google.com and subsequently split into this dedicated wxfalsecolor repository.
